    <h1><strong><em> Welcome to Wayne's Programming Portfolio</em></strong></h1>
    <h2><strong><em>About Wayne</em></strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Hi there!</strong> Wayne is a big knowledge seeker and passionate about making software applications that are human-friendly, emotive, aesthetically pleasing, clear and usable with a touch of mellow smoothness. He is driven by his desire for usability and efficiency starting with a user-centred approach of understanding people's behavior and translating them into design choices.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Do you consider travelling a hobby?</em></strong> Well without a doubt this one of Wayne's favorite hobby. Here are some of the things Wayne learnt and keeps learning on his travelling experiences:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong><em>Learning a new language -</em></strong> It is amazing how quickly one can pick up a language that he or she is surrounded by it. It really accelerates one's learning ability.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Meeting new people -</em></strong> "A journey is measured in friends, rather than miles" Travelling exposes us to new people, new culture and new lifestyle. Whilst most people we meet don't become lifelong friends, the colorful characters we meet on the road become part of the stories we tell for a lifetime</li>
        <li><strong><em>Self reflection -</em></strong> Henry David Thoreau once said "Not until we are lost do we begin to understand ourselves." There is a lot of time for self reflection when travelling. Being away from a normal routine and with ample time waiting at stations and confined to transport, the mind naturally spends time wandering.</li>
        <li><strong><em><span class="unimportant">FOOD</span> -</em></strong> Wayne is a lover of food go checkout on <a href="favourite-things.html">Favourite things.</a></li>
