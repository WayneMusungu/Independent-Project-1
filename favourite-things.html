        <p>I do love trying to have a bite on meals from different cultures. Here are some of my favourite meals that you should also have a try</p>
        <ol>
            <li>炒饭-chǎofàn. Haha! I know you might be wondering what is this but is simply a chinese fried rice.</li>
            <li>Fufu- It is a dough like food mainly found in West African countries like Nigeria and Ghana. Fufu taste similiar like Ugali,stiff porridge made from white cornmeal or red millet, a staple food in Kenya.</li>
            <li>Well fried tilapia fish. This meal slaps hard when it goes with a combination of sukuma wiki(kales) and Ugali one of the best Kenyan dishes.</li>
            <li>Nyama choma and Pombe (Roasted meat and beer). This one of the most Kenyan delicacies that happens during informal social meet ups. The beer and the roasted meat helps one loosen up as they try and catch up with friends.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Right now am picking up on a hobby on learning how to code. I'm glad today I have been able to build this simple webpage, I am very eager to see what how this journey will enable me to impact othe people's lives positively. I also love learning new languages it helps me get an understanding on people's culture.</p>
